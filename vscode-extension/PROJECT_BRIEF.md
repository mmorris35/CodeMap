# PROJECT_BRIEF.md

## Basic Information

- **Project Name**: CodeMap VSCode Extension
- **Project Type**: VSCode Extension
- **Primary Goal**: Provide an interactive visual dependency graph and impact analysis directly in VSCode, powered by the CodeMap CLI.
- **Target Users**: Developers using CodeMap CLI who want visual feedback in their IDE, Teams doing code reviews who want to see impact of changes, Technical leads exploring unfamiliar codebases
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Team Size**: 1

## Functional Requirements

### Key Features (MVP)

1. Webview panel displaying interactive D3.js dependency graph
2. Tree view sidebar showing symbols hierarchically by module
3. CodeLens annotations showing dependent count above functions
4. Click-to-navigate from graph nodes to source file:line
5. Auto-refresh graph when Python files change
6. Impact highlighting - select symbol to highlight affected files in explorer
7. Integration with CodeMap CLI (spawns `codemap analyze --json`)

### Nice-to-Have Features (v2)

- Hover tooltips showing callers/callees on graph nodes
- Filter graph by module or symbol type
- Search/find symbol in graph
- Export graph as PNG/SVG
- Theme support (light/dark matching VSCode)
- Multi-root workspace support
- Graph layout options (hierarchical, force-directed, radial)

## Technical Constraints

### Must Use

- TypeScript
- VSCode Extension API
- D3.js or vis.js for graph rendering
- Webview API for panel

### Cannot Use

- Electron (already in VSCode)
- React/Vue (keep it simple with vanilla JS in webview)

## Other Constraints

- Must work with CodeMap CLI output (CODE_MAP.json)
- Extension size should be under 5MB for marketplace
- Graph must render smoothly for codebases up to 500 symbols
- No external network calls - fully offline
- Support VSCode 1.80+
- Requires CodeMap CLI to be installed (`pip install codemap`)

## Dependencies

- **CodeMap CLI**: This extension requires the CodeMap Python CLI to be installed and accessible in PATH. The extension invokes `codemap analyze --json` to generate dependency data.

## Success Criteria

- All MVP features implemented and working
- Extension installs and activates without errors
- Graph renders within 2 seconds for 500-symbol codebase
- CodeLens appears on Python functions within 1 second of file open
- Click-to-navigate works for all graph nodes
- Extension passes VSCode marketplace validation
- Documentation complete with GIFs showing features
